Clear Objectives: Each question should have a clear and precise objective that aligns with the overall purpose of the survey. Ambiguous or broad questions may lead to varied interpretations and inaccuracies.

Neutrality: Questions should be designed to be neutral and should not lead the respondent towards a specific answer. Any form of leading questions, intentional or unintentional, introduces bias into the results.

Language Appropriateness: The language used should be straightforward, easy to understand, and suitable for the target demographic. Complex or technical language can alienate respondents, potentially skewing your data.

No Absolutes or Extremes: Avoid using absolute terms in the questions such as "always" or "never". These terms can be viewed as too extreme, discouraging balanced responses.

Scale Consistency: If using a scale (e.g., 1 to 5 or 1 to 7), the scale should be consistent throughout the survey. Changing the scale mid-survey could confuse respondents and affect data accuracy.

Avoid Double-Barreled Questions: Questions should focus on one issue at a time. Double-barreled questions, which ask about two different topics simultaneously, can lead to unclear responses.

Avoid False Dichotomies: Multiple answer options should be provided where possible. Giving only two options when more exist can create a false dichotomy and bias results.

Ensure Mutually Exclusive and Exhaustive Answer Options: In multiple-choice questions, answer options should not overlap and should cover all potential responses. This reduces confusion and ensures all potential answers are covered.

Avoid Negatively Worded Questions: Questions should not be worded in a way that makes the respondent feel negatively or pressured into a certain answer. Such questions can lead to response bias.

Periodic Evaluation and Adaptation: It is essential to continually evaluate and adapt the polling system to ensure its fairness, objectivity, and relevance. This includes analyzing bias and inaccuracies and making necessary adjustments.
